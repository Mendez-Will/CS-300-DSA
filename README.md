Coursework from CS-300-DSA


This course taught me the basics of data structures and how to use them in practical situations. 

The given problem for this project was to gather course details from a selected document and print out said course details alphanumerically using a selected data structure. The project also asked us to print out example schedules for students to gather prerequisites from the selected document and print them as well. 

I used a hash data structure for my solution. It was the most efficient way to code this in my opinion and it allowed to actual code to not be as long as expected. 

This project was also challenging, as we had no framework to work with and it had to come from scratch, though by looking at my past work I was able to find the inspiration for this code structure. By doing this I was able to see why saving previous work and taking my time while coding this is so valuable. This project was done over the course of a week and showed me how important time management is when working on projects with a hard deadline. 

Due to having a week, I made sure my code was legible and logical. Comments are more important than I had previously thought, as I was able to save my ideas in the actual code itself and leave the momentum in the code so it was easier to get back into it. Having the functions placed in the menu options also helped in segmenting the code and keeping my schedule on track. 

This project evolved my code by making me think more logically about the problems I am given and how to use my skills to make solutions in a more timely manner. It has made my planning much better and has boosted my confidence in data structures and solving problems using them.
